# SOCIAL MEDIA APP using REACT

This project involves developing a simple social media application using React.js, leveraging the fetch API and React hooks. The app enables users to view a feed of posts retrieved from an API, where the fetch function is used to get and display data like user POSTS. React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, manage state and side effects, ensuring real-time data fetching and rendering.This project demonstrates handling API requests, state management, and the dynamic nature of social media interactions in React.
